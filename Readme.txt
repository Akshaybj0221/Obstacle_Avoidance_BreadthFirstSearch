Directions to Run the program: 
	- To run the code "python3" and "pygame" must be installed on the PC. 
	- Go inside Python scripts subfolder and double click on "BFS_Grid1.py" file

							OR

	- Just open the command prompt go to the directory where the code is downloaded. 
	- Now type “python BFS_Grid1.py” 
        - The code will start running (wait for the computation to complete)
	- And a window with output will appear along with a text output
	- Also, 3 new files will be generated by the name of “NodesInfo.csv”, "pathNodes.csv", and "nodeSet.csv".


Some information about the code and files: 
	- The code stops when the goal is found or more than 100,000 nodes have been generated (in the "visited" list).
	- The algorithm makes sure that it does not copy the same nodes in the "Visited" list.
	- The path is computed and stored in "pathNodes.csv" file whereas all the visited nodes are stored in "nodeSet.csv" file.
	- The index to parent nodes along with cost are stored in the file "NodesInfo.csv".

Understanding the Output:
	- Screenshots are stored inside Output Screenshot subfolder for different combinations of start and goal node.
	- In the output "Red" color shows "Visited nodes", "Black" color shows "obstacle space nodes", "Yellow" color shows "path nodes".
